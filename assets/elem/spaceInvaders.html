    <h1>The Space Invaders</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Space Invaders is a fixed shooter in which the player controls a laser cannon by moving it horizontally across the bottom of the screen and firing at descending aliens. The aim is to defeat six rows of eleven aliens that move horizontally back and forth across the screen as they advance toward the bottom of the screen. The player's laser cannon is partially protected by several stationary defense bunkers that are gradually destroyed from the top and bottom by blasts from either the aliens or the player.</p>
    <p>The player defeats an alien and earns points by shooting it with the laser cannon. As more aliens are defeated, the aliens' movement both speed up. Defeating all the aliens on-screen brings another wave that is more difficult, a loop which can continue endlessly.A special "mystery ship" will occasionally move across the top of the screen and award bonus points if destroyed.</p>
    <p>The aliens attempt to destroy the player's cannon by firing projectiles while they approach the bottom of the screen. Bases are lost upon being destroyed. Play continues until the alien reaches the bottom of the screen, when the game is over.</p>
