    <h1>The USSR-POMODORO timer</h1>
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>A new timer that helps you focus on completing your goals at work. Use your countdown timer to keep yourself on track by setting a goal for how long you want to work on each task.</p>
    <p>USSR-POMODORO provides a simple, but effective, UI to manage these periods of focus and relaxation. USSR-POMODORO is based on the Pomodoro technique for time management. When faced with any large task or series of tasks, break the work down into short, timed intervals (called 'Pomodoros') that are spaced out by short breaks. This allows you to immerse your mind, and get good work done.</p>
